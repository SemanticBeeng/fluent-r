The Fluent R library offers a simple solution for R analytics integration within any Java, Groovy, Scala or Clojure application. The library exposes a simple and intuitive natural language interface called the Fluent R DSL. This DSL supports the declaration and execution of R analytics services offered by popular open source R integration servers, including <a href="http://deployr.revolutionanalytics.com">DeployR</a> and <a href="http://opencpu.org">OpenCPU</a>.
